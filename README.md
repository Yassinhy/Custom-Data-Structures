# Custom Data Structures

Welcome to my **Custom Data Structures** repository! This project is dedicated to implementing and exploring various custom data structures from scratch. The goal is to understand the inner workings of these data structures, improve my programming skills, and share my implementations with others.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:
- **Learn and Practice**: Deepen my understanding of data structures by implementing them from scratch.
- **Document Progress**: Keep a record of my implementations and thought processes.
- **Share Knowledge**: Provide clear and well-documented code for others to learn from.
- **Prepare for Interviews**: Strengthen my problem-solving skills and prepare for technical interviews.

## Data Structures Implemented

This repository includes implementations of the following data structures:
- **Arrays**
- **Linked Lists**
  - Singly Linked List
  - Doubly Linked List
  - Circular Linked List
- **Stacks**
- **Queues**
  - Linear Queue
  - Circular Queue
  - Priority Queue
- **Trees**
  - Binary Tree
  - Binary Search Tree (BST)
  - AVL Tree
  - Heap (Min-Heap and Max-Heap)
- **Graphs**
  - Adjacency List
  - Adjacency Matrix
  - Graph Traversal (BFS and DFS)
- **Hash Tables**
- **Trie**
- **Advanced Structures**
  - Segment Tree
  - Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree)
  - Disjoint Set Union (DSU)

Each data structure is implemented in one or more programming languages, with detailed explanations and examples.
