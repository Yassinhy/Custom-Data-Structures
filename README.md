# Custom Data Structures and useful functions

Welcome to my **Custom Data Structures** repository! This project is dedicated to implementing and exploring various custom data structures from scratch. The goal is to understand the inner workings of these data structures, improve my programming skills, and share my implementations with others.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to:
- **Learn**: Deepen my understanding of data structures by implementing them from scratch.
- **Practice**: Practice my coding and problem solving skills
- **Document Progress**: Keep a record of my implementations and thought processes.
- **Share Knowledge**: Provide clear and well-documented code for others to learn from.
- **Prepare for Interviews**: Strengthen my problem-solving skills and prepare for technical interviews.

## Data Structures Implemented

This repository includes implementations of the following data structures:

-Stacks

-Run-Length Encoder

-Quick Sorter

-Array Merger
